## Challenges in ML

### summary
- efficiency of ml model depends on quality and accuracy of data

### what to do
#### focus on the big picture
ML development workflow
- data collection and data verficication
- feature extraction and analysis
- infrastructure, monitoring and resource management
- model development
- process management

#### breaking down silos
- data scientist
- data engineers
- developers and operations
- a business subject-matter expert


### overview of ml platform
#### main characters
- a complete ecosystem: data, ml, application
- build on open standard
- self-serving:
  - provide resource on demand and automatically

#### capabilities
- workflow automation
    - create repetitive task such as data injestion, model training, model deployment
- secruity
    - prevent data leaks and data loss
- obervability
  - monitor health and performance of the entire system
- logging
    - solid logging system
- data processing and pipeline
- model packaging and deployment
- ml lifecycle management
  - manage ml experiements
  - tracing performance
  - store training and experiments metadata and feature set
  - store versioning models
- on demand resource allocation
