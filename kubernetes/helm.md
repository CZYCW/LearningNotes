### What is helm
- Helm is widely known as the package manager for kubernetes.
- The path Helm took to solve this issue was to create Helm Charts. Each chart is a bundle with one or more Kubernetes manifests â€“ a chart can have child charts and dependent charts as well.

### features
- version your manifest files -> keeping specific configurations for your infrastructure in the form of code.
- keeps a release history of all deployed charts
- templating: add variable and use functions inside your template files.
